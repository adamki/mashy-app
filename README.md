### Mashy App

Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

The project requirements are explained [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md).


### Pitch

Mashy provides provides a simple webapp interface that allows a user to gain insight for any startup.

### Problem

Much of the Startup research I have tried to do has been pretty scattered and/or displayed in a way that I don't like. I decided to build a central tool that will give me the details I am most interested about.

### Solution

Mashy App focuses on UI/UX and data collection across multiple API's.

### Target Audience

Investors. Developers. Thinkers, Tinkerers. Comsumers

### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?

### Learning Goals
* Learning how to build a full Rails app from idea to delivery
* Revisiting previous concepts such as APIs and OAuth
* Finding the strengths and gaps in your knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and organizing a project.

### Technical Expectations

* You must use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users
* You must consume an external API
* You must implement a production quality user interface
* You must optimize your application optimizing your database, implementing caching, using background workers, and sending AJAX requests

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every checkin
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough technical challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a content challenge)
